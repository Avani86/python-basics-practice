# Student Class Practice (Python OOP)

This is a beginner-level Python program to practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

### ðŸ“Œ What the Code Does:
- Creates a `Student` class with name, age, rank, and gender
- Prints student details using `student_details()` method
- Checks if the student is a topper using `is_topper()` method

### ðŸ’¡ What I Learned:
- How to create a class and constructor (`__init__`)
- Using `self` to access object data
- Writing and calling methods inside a class
- Creating and using objects

###ðŸ§ª Example:

```python
s1 = Student("Veronica", 18, 1, "Female")
s1.student_details()
s1.is_topper()

Output:
Name of the student is Veronica
Age of the student is 18
Rank of the student is 1
Gender of the student is Female
Veronica is the topper
