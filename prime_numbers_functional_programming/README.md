# ðŸ§  Prime Filter & Functional Flow â€“ Python Mini Project

This is a Python practice project that explores:
- Function with parameters and return values
- Conditional logic (if/else)
- Prime number checker
- Functional programming using `filter()`, `map()`, and `reduce()`

---

## ðŸ”§ What I Used

- `def` with parameters and `return`
- `if/else` conditions to check even or odd
- Prime number checker function using range and modulus
- `filter()` to select prime numbers
- `map()` to transform data (added +10 to each prime)
- `reduce()` to combine the mapped values into a single result

---

```## Output Example
12
12 is even
Prime numbers are: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]
Mapped primes : [12, 13, 15, 17, 21]
Reduced (sum of mapped primes): 78
```

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- How to use `return` to store values from a function
- Difference between `print()` and `return`
- How to check if a number is prime using a loop
- How `filter()` works with a custom condition
- That `map()` transforms data item-by-item
- That `reduce()` returns a **single** final value by combining all elements
- The importance of importing specific functions (`from functools import reduce`)

---

## ðŸ’¬ Personal Note
At first, I didnâ€™t understand how `return` works inside loops. 
I thought the loop should always finish, but then I realized that if a condition is met, `return` just ends the whole function. 
That made my prime checker confusing at first ,
but I finally understood how return gives back a value and how itâ€™s different from print().
