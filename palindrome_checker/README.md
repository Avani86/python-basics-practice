# ðŸ”„ Palindrome Checker

This beginner Python project checks whether a given number is a **palindrome** or not.  
A palindrome number reads the same backward as forward â€” like `121`, `1331`, or `44`.

### ðŸ’¡ How it works:
- The program takes a number as input
- It reverses the number using a while loop and math
- It compares the original and reversed number
- If they match, it prints that it's a palindrome!

### ðŸ§ª Example:
```Input: 121```
```Output: It is a Palindrome Number```

```Input: 123```
```Output: It is not a Palindrome Number```

### ðŸ§  What I Learned
This project helped me understand:
- Modulo operator `%` to extract digits
- Integer division `//` to remove digits
- Reversing logic using `rev = rev*10 + digit`
- How to compare the original and reversed numbers
