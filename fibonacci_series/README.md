# 04_fibonacci_series

This Python program generates the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` terms entered by the user.

## What I learned:
- How Fibonacci numbers work
- How to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` for logic
- How to loop and shift values with `a`, `b`, and `c`

```## Example output:
Enter a number: 6
0
1
1
2
3
5

`ðŸ§  Each new number is made by adding the previous two!
