# 🔁 Reverse a Number – Python Project

This is a beginner-level Python program that takes a number from the user and prints the reverse of that number.

---

## 💡 What It Does

- Takes a number as input
- Reverses its digits using a loop
- Prints the reversed number

Example:
```Input = 3647`
Output= 7463```

---

## 📚 What I Used

- `while` loop  
- `%` to get the last digit  
- `//` to remove the last digit  
- Simple math to build the reversed number  

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to break a number down digit by digit  
- How to rebuild the reversed number using logic  
- What `%` and `//` actually do  
- How to follow the logic step by step instead of just copying code
